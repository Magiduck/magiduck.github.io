I currently work as a student-assistant at the Bachelor of Bioinformatics from the Hanze University of Applied Sciences, where I am also a student in the master program Data Science for Life Sciences.

Before this I worked on a research collaboration with Daan F. van den Berg and Franklin L. Nobrega on the DefenseSystemFinder tool.

I recently finished my Bachelor of Science in Bioinformatics at the HAN University of Applied Sciences in Nijmegen.

I did my Bachelor End Project at Naturalis in the analysis of automatic insect camera data. This project involved the detection, tracking, segmentation, identification and biomass estimation of insects with the use of deep learning.

As part of my bachelor in Bioinformatics I did a minor in Sensor System Engineering at the Hanze Institute of Technology.

Before this I worked as an Bioinformatics Intern at Kavli Institute of Nanoscience, TU Delft – Brouns lab. Here I developed DAGGER, a tool for the interactive graph-based visualization of genome architecture comparisons.

I have also worked briefly (three months) as a front-end PHP developer at Omnext.
